Use the existing components as a reference to maintain consistency with the template's design and functionality. Next, within the <i>agency.json</i> file, create an item for the new section, where you can define all the necessary data such as texts, links, and other information. Lastly, create a new instance of your custom section inside the <i>App.vue</i> file. After completing these steps, your new section should be fully integrated into the theme."

            "question": "Can I expect the template to be responsive and work well on mobile devices?",
            "answer": "Absolutely! The template is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it adapts to various screen types and sizes, including mobile devices. The use of responsive design techniques like media queries and flexible layout ensures that the template looks and functions well on smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. During customization, make sure to preview the template on different screen sizes and devices to ensure it displays correctly. If you encounter any issues, you can adjust the CSS styles or layout accordingly to improve the mobile experience further."
